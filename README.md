# Multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model – Hylia

## Overview
**Hylia** is an advanced multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to handle and understand text across multiple languages without requiring pre-segmented input or language-specific preprocessing. Developed within the context of computational social science research, Hylia enables the analysis of large, multilingual text corpora using modern machine learning techniques like support vector machines and deep learning architectures.

## Features
- **Multilingual Text Processing**: Automatic language detection and cross-lingual understanding without word-aligned or language-specific training data.
- **Tokenization**: Advanced multilingual tokenization that handles various scripts and alphabets with fairness across languages.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Statistical and neural network-based POS tagging, including applications for low-resource languages like Marathi.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Recognition of people, locations, organizations using hybrid rule-based and machine-learning-based methods.
- **Machine Translation**: Multilingual machine translation capabilities with focus on low-resource languages.
- **Cross-lingual Word Embeddings**: Semantic vector representations that align across different languages.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Multilingual sentiment detection at the document level.
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Event-centric extraction of entities, participants, time, and location for knowledge base creation.

## Model Architecture
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with TF-IDF and n-gram features for initial language detection.
- **Transformer-based models** (BERT, mBERT, XLM-R) for deep semantic understanding.
- **Modular Processing Pipeline** combining tokenization, sentence splitting, named entity linking, semantic role labeling, and time normalization.
- **Hypergraph Representation** of social media interactions to capture system dynamics over time.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **BLEU Score** for translation quality (e.g., English → Arabic: 78% BLEU).
- **F1 Score** for NER and classification tasks (e.g., Transformer models achieving 88% F1).
- **Accuracy and Precision** for overall NLP pipeline evaluations.
- **Intrinsic Evaluation Metrics** focused on fairness, bias, and representation across languages.

## Applications
- **Social Media Analysis**: Extract macro-level patterns from massive online communication datasets.
- **Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval**: Find and retrieve documents across different languages effectively.
- **Machine Translation and Paraphrasing**: Develop multilingual paraphrasing systems for diverse linguistic communities.
- **Low-Resource Language Support**: Expand NLP capabilities to understudied and endangered languages.
- **Multimodal Multilingual NLP**: Integrate NLP with visual and speech modalities for richer interpretation (e.g., Emotion Detection).

## Challenges Addressed
- **Language Diversity and Fairness**: Ensures fair treatment across languages with different character sets and scripts.
- **Low-Resource Language Processing**: Employs transfer learning and cross-lingual techniques to overcome data scarcity.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Tackles bias, privacy, data protection, and coloniality issues inherent in multilingual NLP projects.

## Future Directions
- **Zero-shot Learning**: Extending capabilities to languages never seen during training.
- **Neurosymbolic AI Integration**: Combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning for more interpretable NLP systems.
- **Multimodal Translation**: Combining audio, video, and text for next-generation translation and comprehension models.

## Getting Started
```bash
# Install required libraries
pip install transformers scikit-learn

# Example: Run Multilingual Named Entity Recognition
from transformers import pipeline

nlp = pipeline("ner", model="xlm-roberta-large", tokenizer="xlm-roberta-large")
text = "Barack Obama visited Paris in 2023."
print(nlp(text))
```
